## Explanation of the Query Plan:

This query plan describes the steps involved in executing a SQL query. Here's a breakdown of each step:

**Overall:**

- The query plan shows that the total cost of executing the query was 760.74 (estimated) and 761.07 (actual).
- The query took 582.382 milliseconds to plan and 269.430 milliseconds to execute.
- The output of the query consists of 33 rows, each with 27 columns.

**Step 1: Hash Right Join**

- This step joins two tables: `empregados` (e) and `departamentos` (d), based on the condition `e.dep_id = d.dep_id`.
- The join is performed using a **Hash Right Join** algorithm, which is efficient when the join column on the right-hand side (d) has a small number of distinct values.
- The estimated cost of this step is 1.74, the actual cost is 53.044, and the actual time taken is 188.717 milliseconds.
- The join produces 20,000 rows with 23 columns each.

**Step 1.1: Seq Scan on empregados**

- This step scans all rows of the `empregados` table sequentially.
- The estimated cost is 0.00, the actual cost is 13.808, and the actual time taken is 127.819 milliseconds.
- This step outputs 20,000 rows with 8 columns each.

**Step 1.2: Hash on departamentos**

- This step builds a hash table on the `departamentos` table using the `dep_id` column.
- The estimated cost is 1.33, the actual cost is 39.190, and the actual time taken is 39.191 milliseconds.
- The hash table has 1024 buckets and uses 10kB of memory.
- This step outputs 33 rows with 19 columns each.

**Step 1.3: Seq Scan on departamentos**

- This step scans all rows of the `departamentos` table sequentially.
- The estimated cost is 0.00, the actual cost is 8.096, and the actual time taken is 8.109 milliseconds.
- This step outputs 33 rows with 19 columns each.

**Step 2: HashAggregate**

- This step aggregates the joined data based on the `d.dep_id` and `d.nome` columns.
- The aggregation function is not specified in the plan, but it could be something like `COUNT(*)`, `SUM(salary)`, or `AVG(age)`.
- The estimated cost of this step is 760.74, the actual cost is 761.07, and the actual time taken is 207.076 milliseconds.
- The aggregation outputs 33 rows with 27 columns each.

**Summary:**

- This query plan shows that the majority of the cost and time is spent on the Hash Right Join step.
- The Hash Right Join is likely efficient because the `departamentos` table has a small number of distinct values for the `dep_id` column.
- The HashAggregate step also takes some time, but it is likely because there are many rows to aggregate and the aggregation function is complex.

**Additional notes:**

- The plan shows both estimated and actual costs and times for each step. The actual values may be different from the estimated values due to factors such as data distribution and hardware resources.
- The plan also shows the number of batches, memory usage, and number of buckets used for each step. This information can be helpful for understanding how the query is being executed and for identifying potential bottlenecks.
